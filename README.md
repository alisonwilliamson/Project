# Project

USER STORY:

Target Audience: People looking to plan their trip knowing weather forecast and places to stay and things to do. 

Goal: Show places and activities with the inclusion of a weather for the week (7-days).

I want to look up where I can go, and I want to know WHAT the weather forecast will be AND WHAT activities are available and places to go/stay.  
WHEN user searches CITY, THEN user is presented with weather, location, lodging, and activity options. The weather API will show a weekly weather forecast so users know what to expect and can plan accordingly. Through RapidAPI, we will pull information on location, lodging and activities based on TripAdivsor information. 

APIs Useed:
*Weather - Open Weather API
*Trip - TripAdvisor via Rapid API
